Steps followed in developing custom API for library application

Ruby
Used the ruby programming functionality to build the MVC modal of the application.
Created different ruby files to handle the flow of data accross the backend of the application.
Controller are used for communicating with the modal and the view to control the differnt operation on the profile resource.
Ruby modal to communicate with the database to define the relationship amongs the resources and control the database.
Rails
Used rails framework for developing custom API for the library.
Hosted the rails api to the heroku.com to test the api from the client browser over the internet.
HTML – Created a simple page using the bootstrap – Created form for user to sign up, sign in, change password using modal – Buttons for list profiles, clear profiles and search for profiles are made using bootstrap buttons features. – All the form has the event listener which triggers the jQuery to send the data around the files and finally to api and back to the application browser. – Created the footer which gives all the feedback with every event with the profile.

Javascript – Created the profile functionality in the application using the javascript functions. – All the event on the profiles calls different javascript function which does different work.

Functions to Sign Up a users

Function to Sign In a user and store that user data in the store.js file to access later

Function to change password using the data saved for that user in the store.js

Function to Sign Out the user using the same information stored for that user.

jQuery – All the event on the profile resource are handle by the jQuery functions.

I used on(‘click’) function on all the buttons when there are clicked to update the profiles.

I use the jQuery to set the class for these click to get the different css triggered

jQuery is also used to populate all the different feedback on different event on during the profiles

AJAX – All the functions that are called during the event listener triggered used the AJAX to communicate with the api to return the information back from api like user login informations – Every CRUD request does the AJAX call to make changes to the resource in api.

CSS – The client application UI is using SCSS bootstrap. – multiple scss files are used to give different look for the application.

Documentation

Backend Application (Storage and organization profiles resources)

API Repo: https://github.com/tenmediatech/project-4-api
API Deployed: https://weathermeapi.herokuapp.com/
API on deployed version will handle all the AJEX call for all the operations on the resource on the database where the request comes from the client application. API has the all the MVC setup for processing the resources over the application.

The Backend application serve the proper restful route for both the users and profiles.

The controller modal are set to Open Record where users can search through the profiles but will need the authentication access to do update or delete the resource.

Frontend Application (Povide users to login and access profiles)

Client Repo: https://github.com/tenmediatech/project-4-client
Client Deployed:
The client application is organize to make restful request for the resources to display on the browser. Each of the opereation on the frontend application is distributed amongs various function to properly rander resouses to the user. All the UI portion of the frontend handle all the actual visual impact on the browser. What information and visual experience user get is decited at this level of application. UI for all the authentication is designed to peroperly intake the input data from the user to provide the required authentication back to user and drive them to the different areas of the application.

Following are ways frontend application is designed to interaction with user.

Sign In, Sign Out, Change Password
Add profile, Show all profiles, Search One profile, Update profile and Delete profile.
Technologies used – React Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, AJEX, DOM, Crome – Google, Stack Overflow

Technical Specifications

– Custom API for Library version 1 develop by Tenzin Migmar – Browser base single-page profile application with no browser refresh. – Render a profile board in the browser. – User can can create multiple profiles and list all the profiles in the library. – All the event on the profile resource is hanbdle with jQuery for DOM manipulation. – All the request to API or posting to api is done through Ajax call.

Interaction with API – Used the create profile function to create every new profile in API. – When the user enter the id of the profile and new title of the profile it will update the data in the API. – With List profile button on the profile user can get all of the profiles in the library or there can see the perticular profile using the id of the profile and it searches through the resource on the api. . – All the functions operated on the profiles will be communicating with the api to perform right operation.

Authentication Specifications – Signup with email, password, and password confirmation. – Login with email and password. – Logout when logged in. – Change password with current and new password. – Signup and Sign-in must only be available to not signed in users. – Logout and Change password must only be available to signed in users. – Give feedback to the user after each action’s success or failure. – All forms must clear after submit success or failure

Unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.

Many to many relationship amongs the resources to create flexible resource sharing. Searching the resource using different column than id. Display of the profile on the browser can be improved a lots in future.
